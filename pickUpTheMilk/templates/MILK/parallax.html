        <p> Our website acts as a <strong> collaborative shopping list </strong> which simplifies your shared finances. We built it with communal living in mind â€“
          if a shared item is running low, add it to the shopping list which will display it to ALL your flatmates. On top of this, our budget tracking
          feature means that you can keep a running record of purchases. When you decide it's time to settle up, click a button and our state-of-the-art algorithm
          will figure out everything out for you!
